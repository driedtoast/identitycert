h1. Overview

The pytoaster is a project to setup your python application.
This has come out of the idea that python apps should be able to run independantly much like packaging up other languages such as java, etc...

The project consists of:
* python service script - ability to run python application as a service
* build scripts for packaging and creating a distutils setup
* RPM specs to install your application based on configuration, etc...

Hopefully this will get to a point where it is a geneal packager for python applications.
But its a work in progress.


This is spawning out of snippets and code from the "variouscrumbs":http://github.com/driedtoast/variouscrumbs project on github.
