h1. Overview

Python application to validate a site for the following support:
* oAuth
* SAML2
* JWT

h1. Getting Started

# Clone project
# ./bin/resolvedepends
# python startup.py identitycert

Here comes the hackerific section related to certs:

# Clone CommandLineSigner project
# Build in eclipse (just need a class file in bin) 
# chmod +x CommandLineSigner/xmlsign

Reason for this is I needed to get xml signature compatible with java validation quickly for saml bearer, don't like it but it works.
